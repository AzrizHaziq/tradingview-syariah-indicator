// Load this file if your server code is bundled. For example:
//  - Cloudflare Workers needs the entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.
//  - Vercel bundles serverless functions behind the scenes.

// The path of following dependencies are normally determined dynamically at run-time; this file makes these dependencies discoverable at build-time so that bundlers are able to determine the entire dependency tree.
