          This will be totally <b>free</b>. Reason being is that, I wanted to help those who want to trade individual
          stocks, rather than buying a basket of stocks(ETF/Unit trust). Hence, I hope that muslim will now be able to
          trade confidently under Shariah Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          AFAIK, I do find that most of the guideline have a little different one to another but these posts should help
          you understand what are the criteria:

        </ul>
        <p>
          Lastly, when opening an account with Broker, in my humble opinion just open a<b> Cash upfront account</b>. It
          means, you only invest the money that you have in your account and avoid using other people money. Only do it
          if you are aware of the risks and etc.
        </p>

              Before buying you should spend your time learning and understanding <b>Zakat</b> types and its
              calculation. Avoiding Zakat will not smoothen your afterlife journey.

              Things can go south like the <b>data is not up to date</b>. As currently I'm manually updating the data on
              every Malaysia weekend.

            <li>
              If you can't find the stock that you are looking for, it's not necessarily mean it's not <b>Shariah</b>.

                  AFAIK currently, VP-DJ Shariah capped up to 100 stocks. Thus, you can perform you own quantitative and
                  qualitative assessment
                </li>
                <li>Wahed, its depend on their assessment.</li>
                <li>
                  For Malaysia, we had a very strict regulated Shariah board that do all the assessment and if you don't
                  find the stock, it means it's not shariah-compliance.
